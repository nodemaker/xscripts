# This script needs to be updated urgently
# Heres how the scripts should work
# 1) We do a recursive search for a project with the name of the current gitroot directory 
# if we are in a git repo or the current parent directory if we are not
# 2) If this doesnt work and we are in a git repo then we add search for a project with all the directory
# names until the git repo
# 3) The script can take a parameter and then use the word in its matches
# 4) The script can also show the user the history of all projects it has opened before and the user can select 
# one of them
#
#
# Estimated Time Requred - One day

#! /bin/bash
# Script that will run find an xcode project in any directory and run it in xcode
# The name of the xcode project should be same as the name of the parent directory
# The project can be in any branch of the directory tree
# If there are multiple projects with the name of the parent directory then the one
# which is found first by grep will be opened(I think it does BFS)
